Analytical insight on sampling, bias & relevant matters
-------------------------------------------------------


The PSID (Panel Study of Income Dynamics) survey is one of the longest and largest surveys conducted in the world.
Survey begins in 1968 including 18000 people in United States across 5000 families. Huge data set on these individuals and their
descendants has been collected for past 50 years including employment, income, wealth, expenditures, health, marriage,
childbearing, child development, philanthropy, education, and numerous other topics.<br>

When we analyse the data, the main area we considered is how earnings vary against education where we came up with the hypothesis "**People with high education level have high earnings than people with low education levels**".<br>

In-order to evaluate the alternative hypothesis, we have provided relevant statistical details and graphs and finally we have figured out that when education level is higher the earnings also increased.

Also we have figured out below out-comes from the data set as well -
  - Hours and earnings have a strong positive correlation inferring higher hours spent allow higher earnings
  - Education and kids have significant negative correlation inferring residents with relatively higher education levels tend to have less children
  - Earnings and kids have a significant negative correlation inferring families with relatively high income tend to raise less children

Sampling:
---------
Since in the PSID itself mentioned that they have considered nearly 18,000 individuals for the research but the data provided only containing nearly 4900 related data, we can come to a conclusion that the data is already sampled.<br>
But for analytical purposes, we have sampled the given data set with 800 individual records in which the case we can generate more precise outcome.
 
Bias:
----
Since this is worldwide research, their target population should be all the individuals in the world. But they only collect data from families who live in the United States. Therefore at the very beginning, we can conclude that this data set is geographically biased.
